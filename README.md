# ZachMediaPlayer

ZachMediaPlayer is a media player program made using Windows Forms and LibVLCSharp. As such, it supports a wide variety of formats and codecs out of the box.

## Why use this instead of VLC?

ZachMediaPlayer has a cleaner, simpler UI compared to VLC, potentially making it easier for some people to use.
